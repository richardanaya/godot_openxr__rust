A simple project to show how to do VR with PBR.

Look at the RightController.gd script to see how controls are detected.

Look at the Main.gd to see how the OpenXR session is started ( this is just boiler plate from the website tutorials).

Importantly in the project settings I set renderer to Forward+ and turned on XR and XR Shaders (important!)
